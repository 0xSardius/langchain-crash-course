# TODO: Walk people how to install all the dependencies and start the conda environment

# Goal

The LangChain docs are confusing and it's hard to get everything running on your computer properly. What I want to do is break down all of the core components so that you know what they are and how to use them.

Everything is really spread out which is put everything together for you in one place.

This tutorial is aimed at beginners who are looking to start their journey as an AI engineer.

We're going to be covering the following sections: ChatModels, Prompt Templates, [TODO: FILL OUT REST]:

- Don't call out the sections, just list them out visually

Each section will be broken down into the following format:

- What is it?
- Why is it important?
- How do I use it? Desired end goal.
- Additional use cases with examples.
- TODO: Put the sections on the left side of the screen and the breakdown on the right.

I've added timestamps to each section so you can jump to the part you need help with.

LangChain is broken down into 3 parts:

1. Model I/O
2. Retrieval
3. Composition
